# Collage Project for After Effects

This is a customizable collage template for Adobe After Effects, designed to help you quickly arrange and animate multiple elements into a cohesive collage composition.

## Description

The project allows you to create a dynamic collage by simply adding your elements and controlling their stacking order and placement through a dedicated control layer. All positioning and scaling are managed automatically via expressions, making the workflow fast and flexible.

## How It Works

1. **Add Your Elements:**  
   Place all your image or video layers *under* the `Controls&Settings` layer in the timeline.

2. **Copy Expressions:**  
   Copy the provided expressions from the `Position` and `Scale` properties of a sample layer.

3. **Paste Expressions:**  
   Paste these expressions into the `Position` and `Scale` properties of every element you add to the collage.

4. **Set Layer Order:**  
   In the `Controls&Settings` layer, choose which element should appear first in the collage. All other layers will automatically arrange themselves according to the settings, creating a seamless collage effect.

## Features

- Easy to use: just add layers and paste expressions
